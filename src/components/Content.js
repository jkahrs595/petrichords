          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
          of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
          name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
          of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
          lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
          and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
          brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My
          vengeance upon thee.{" "}

          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
          you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
          don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
          case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
          much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
          ass.{" "}

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
          all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
          arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
          most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
          back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me
          Mr Glass.{" "}
